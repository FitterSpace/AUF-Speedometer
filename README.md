## Features:

Displays the player's movement speed, falling speed, position, and health.

Allows you to jump by holding Y instead of pressing it.

## How to Use:

1) Download the latest version of [Dolphin 5.0 Lua Core](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core)
2) Download this script and place it in the "Scripts" folder (Sys > Scripts)
3) Start running the North American version of 007: Agent Under Fire in the emulator
4) While the game is running, go to Tools > Execute Script
5) Find "AuF-Speedometer.lua" in the drop-down list and click "Start"

## Known Issues:

This script only works for the on-foot levels. Driving levels are not supported at the moment.

Multiplayer is not supported. If a bot is in the match, its speed will be shown instead. If there are no bots, player 2's speed will be shown.

The PAL version is not supported.

Sometimes the values on-screen will be 0 for a moment instead of their true value. I don't know why this happens.
